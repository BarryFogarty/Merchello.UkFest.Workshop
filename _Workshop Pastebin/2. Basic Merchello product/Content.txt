Teaspoon Single Fin x 5'8
teaspoon-single-fin-58

If you like single fins and small waves this is the board for you. Really full profile with a super wide button tail makes this super fun on anything a bit lack lustre.

<p>If you like single fins and small waves this is the board for you. Really full profile with a super wide button tail makes this super fun on anything a bit lack lustre. Full and forgiving forward rails thinning out to a wide tail but thin tail there is nothing stodgy about this little fella. The volume is pulled slightly back to spread it evenly between your chest and feet. This give a nice balance between paddling and riding.</p>
<p>Full rails the taper right down to a thin tail rail keep the board lively even in crap surf. The bottom starts with a single concave under the front foot developing into a deep double concave around the fin and flattens out of the back.</p>
<p>Board shown here is in dark blue resin tint.</p>
